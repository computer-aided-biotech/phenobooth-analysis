# phenobooth-analysis

Analysis of phenobooth data from a library screen.

## Requirements

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* Python 3 (comes included in Anaconda)
* Git (or any Git client of your choice, e.g. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))

## Installation

* Create an anaconda environment called `phenobooth-analysis`, with Jupyter Notebook installed in it.
* Clone locally this repository.
* From an anaconda terminal, `cd` to this repository's root and then do:
  ```bash
  conda activate phenobooth-analysis  # activates the new environment
  pip install -r requirements.txt     # installs all dependencies
  conda install -c anaconda graphviz  # Needs to be conda-installed
  type nul > .env                     # creates a .env file for storing passwords
  jupyter notebook                    # runs the jupyter notebook engine
  ```

The initial file and directory structure of this project was developed by a group of participants in the Reproducible Science Curriculum Workshop, held at [NESCent] in December 2014. The structure is based on, and heavily follows the one proposed by [Noble 2009], with a few but small modifications. The [original repository] has been [modified] by Martin Engqvist and the one presented here differs in some ways.
